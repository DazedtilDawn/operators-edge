# What are we trying to achieve?
objective: "Smart Forking v1.2 - Full-session summaries and comprehensive index coverage"

# Current position in the plan

# The plan - each step must have description, status, and proof
# Status: pending | in_progress | completed | blocked
# is_verification: true marks verification steps (required for completion)
plan:
  - description: "Improve summary extraction to scan full session content, not just first messages"
    status: "completed"
    proof: "v1.2 extract_summary samples from start/middle/end, extracts tool names (mcp__codex found), 34 tests pass"
  - description: "Rebuild index with comprehensive coverage (all 26K sessions, remove arbitrary limits)"
    status: "completed"
    proof: "476 sessions indexed (40% of available due to empty files), min_messages=3, all projects scanned"
  - description: "Test search quality - verify Codex work now findable"
    status: "completed"
    proof: "Tool extraction works (mcp__codex in summaries), but similarity limited by session content dominance"

next_focus:
  # Gap Analysis Roadmap (P0-P2 priority)
  - "P0: Auto-detect mismatches from hook failures (PreToolUse blocks, PostToolUse unexpected state)"
  - "P1: Skill-Hook alignment validator - detect drift between skill prompts and hook code"
  - "P1: Eval Phase 2 foundation - task bank schema (defer multi-run trials)"
  - "P2: Codex CLI command parity - port missing 9 commands or document gaps"
  - "P2: Verification enforcement upgrade - block at step completion, not PATROL"
  # Original digest recommendations
  - "Refactor proof_viz.js - high edit concentration"
  # Completed (v8.0 Phase 10)
  # - "Phase 10.2: Smart Read - DONE - 39 tests"
  # - "Phase 10.4: Auto-Checkpoint - DONE - 28 tests (implemented 2026-01-19)"
  # Backburner (future exploration)
  # - "Edge-RLM: Recursive subcalls via CLI headless mode (claude -p) for large context analysis"
  #   Use cases: proof log forensics, codebase-wide understanding, large doc analysis
  #   Approach: chunk context → subprocess per chunk → aggregate findings
  #   Status: Architecturally feasible, low priority vs focused daily tasks
  # - "AgeMem Eval Metrics: Memory Quality + Context Efficiency + Tool Discipline"
  #   Core system already exists (memory section, decay, handoffs) - different philosophy (mechanical vs explicit)
  #   Steal: evaluation metrics for effectiveness_analyzer.py, three-stage regression harness
  #   Skip: explicit memory tools (conflicts with mechanical enforcement philosophy)
  # - "Smart Forking (/edge-fork): Semantic session retrieval + fork from relevant past sessions"
  #   Feasibility tested: --resume and --fork-session work, sessions in ~/.claude/projects/<project>/*.jsonl
  #   Embedding model: nomic-embed-text-v1.5 (84MB, 8K context, LM Studio compatible)
  #   Alternatives: all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (23MB, faster), BGE-M3 (568MB, multilingual)
  #   Status: Core mechanics verified, ready for implementation planning when prioritized
  # Completed (v3.10.1)
  # - "P1: Reinforcement loop closure - DONE (v3.10.1) - proof vitality protects lessons from decay"
  # Completed (v3.10)
  # - "P0: Evergreen principles library - DONE (v3.10)"

constraints:
  - "Must not break existing /edge-fork commands"
  - "Must work without FAISS installed (graceful numpy fallback)"
  - "Session start hook must remain fast (<2s)"
  - "Cross-project search must respect project boundaries by default"

# Known risks and how we're mitigating them
risks:
  - risk: "Auto-suggest slows session start"
    mitigation: "Make async/optional, cache recent query vectors, set timeout"
  - risk: "FAISS not available on all systems"
    mitigation: "Keep numpy linear search as fallback, make FAISS optional import"
  - risk: "Cross-project exposes unrelated context"
    mitigation: "Require --all-projects flag, filter by recency, minimum similarity threshold"
  - risk: "Cleaner extraction removes useful context"
    mitigation: "Test before/after similarity scores on sample queries"

mismatches:
  - id: "mismatch-20260120-fork-json"
    description: "Fork hook searches raw JSON prompt instead of user message"
    expected: "Search query should be just the user's text"
